# TODO for Correcting Error and Improving UI in [id].tsx

## Information Gathered
- The file `RecipeApp/app/recipe/[id].tsx` has an import error: `import {WebView} from " reac-natuve-webview "` â€“ it's misspelled as "reac-natuve-webview" instead of "react-native-webview".
- The package `react-native-webview` is not installed, so I installed it.
- The UI needs to be modernized: change fonts and overall look.
- Current UI uses basic styles; we can enhance with better typography, spacing, shadows, and modern components.
- Themed components are available: `ThemedText` and `ThemedView`.
- Theme constants include colors and fonts.

## Plan
1. Fix the import error in [id].tsx by correcting the package name.
2. Improve UI by:
   - Using `ThemedView` for containers to ensure proper theming.
   - Enhancing typography with better font sizes, weights, and spacing.
   - Adding shadows and borders for a modern look.
   - Improving layout with better padding and margins.
   - Using more modern colors and gradients if possible.
   - Ensuring responsive design.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- `RecipeApp/app/recipe/[id].tsx`: Fix import and update styles.

## Followup Steps
- Test the app to ensure the error is fixed and UI looks modern.
- Run the app and check for any runtime errors.
