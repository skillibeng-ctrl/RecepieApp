Under here is where i'm hightling every step were going to take in this project.

1) Since were going to be woring with an API I wanted us to try something different, saving the data from the API into a Monngodb cluster and using ur own backend APi to call them in. This is important because it help us us keep track of the data and not only that enables us to access alot more other fields and let us use the skills we learnt in Mongodb into good use.

2) It's much faster reliable and allows us more access to the data for the filteriong aspect which we would be adding soon. If your reading this then i have shared the task and you have already started with your part. Now this isa what we do. The ReadMe.md file allows us to communicate with ourselves, share experiences and also warnings. So please read through it carefully before starting on your tasks.

3. I've already began the home page and i've initialised the API with our database and we wont be using Mongodb, No we'll using something much more structured superbase cause we have experience using it so we will be able to under, So for now lets focus on the frontend and get the UI done.
